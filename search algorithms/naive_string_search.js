//Time complexity: O(m * n). The m is the size of pattern and n is the size of the main string

      //the if block below checks if the entire short pattern has been run. If that happens, it means that a break didn't occur, and so there's a match, so we increase the count. We have to put an if check, otherwise the count would increase for each character match, not for the whole pattern match.
